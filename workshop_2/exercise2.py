# 1 is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?


# 2 Check permutation: Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.


# 3 URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. 
# EXAMPLE
# Input: "Mr John Smith ", 13
# Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"


# 4 Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
# EXAMPLE
# Input: Tact Coa
# Output: True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco eta", etc.)


# 5. String Compression: Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2b1c5a3. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters(a - z).
